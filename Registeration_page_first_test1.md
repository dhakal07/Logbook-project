## Alert Detail



### [ CSP: Wildcard Directive ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10055/)



##### Medium (High)

### Description

Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks. Including (but not limited to) Cross Site Scripting (XSS), and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

* URL: http://0.0.0.0:8000/
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `content-security-policy`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self';`
  * Other Info: `The following directives either allow wildcard sources (or ancestors), are not defined, or are overly broadly defined:
frame-ancestors, form-action

The directive(s): frame-ancestors, form-action are among the directives that do not fallback to default-src, missing/excluding them is the same as allowing anything.`
* URL: http://0.0.0.0:8000/login
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `content-security-policy`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self';`
  * Other Info: `The following directives either allow wildcard sources (or ancestors), are not defined, or are overly broadly defined:
frame-ancestors, form-action

The directive(s): frame-ancestors, form-action are among the directives that do not fallback to default-src, missing/excluding them is the same as allowing anything.`
* URL: http://0.0.0.0:8000/register
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `content-security-policy`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self';`
  * Other Info: `The following directives either allow wildcard sources (or ancestors), are not defined, or are overly broadly defined:
frame-ancestors, form-action

The directive(s): frame-ancestors, form-action are among the directives that do not fallback to default-src, missing/excluding them is the same as allowing anything.`

Instances: 3

### Solution

Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is properly configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

### [ Missing Anti-clickjacking Header ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10020/)



##### Medium (Medium)

### Description

The response does not protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks. It should include either Content-Security-Policy with 'frame-ancestors' directive or X-Frame-Options.

* URL: http://0.0.0.0:8000/
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `x-frame-options`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: http://0.0.0.0:8000/login
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `x-frame-options`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: http://0.0.0.0:8000/register
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `x-frame-options`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``

Instances: 3

### Solution

Modern Web browsers support the Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options HTTP headers. Ensure one of them is set on all web pages returned by your site/app.
If you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY. Alternatively consider implementing Content Security Policy's "frame-ancestors" directive.

#### WASC Id: 15

#### Source ID: 3

### [ Application Error Disclosure ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90022/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

This page contains an error/warning message that may disclose sensitive information like the location of the file that produced the unhandled exception. This information can be used to launch further attacks against the web application. The alert could be a false positive if the error message is found inside a documentation page.

* URL: http://0.0.0.0:8000/register
  * Method: `POST`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error`
  * Other Info: ``

Instances: 1

### Solution

Review the source code of this page. Implement custom error pages. Consider implementing a mechanism to provide a unique error reference/identifier to the client (browser) while logging the details on the server side and not exposing them to the user.

### [ X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10021/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.

* URL: http://0.0.0.0:8000/
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `x-content-type-options`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `This issue still applies to error type pages (401, 403, 500, etc.) as those pages are often still affected by injection issues, in which case there is still concern for browsers sniffing pages away from their actual content type.
At "High" threshold this scan rule will not alert on client or server error responses.`
* URL: http://0.0.0.0:8000/login
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `x-content-type-options`
  * Attack: ``

  * Other Info: `This issue still applies to error type pages (401, 403, 500, etc.) as those pages are often still affected by injection issues, in which case there is still concern for browsers sniffing pages away from their actual content type.

Instances: 3

### Solution

Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' for all web pages.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.

#### Source ID: 3

### [ Authentication Request Identified ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10111/)



##### Informational (High)

### Description

The given request has been identified as an authentication request. The 'Other Info' field contains a set of key=value lines which identify any relevant fields. If the request is in a context which has an Authentication Method set to "Auto-Detect" then this rule will change the authentication to match the request identified.

* URL: http://0.0.0.0:8000/login
  * Method: `POST`
  * Parameter: `username`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `password`
  * Other Info: `userParam=username
userValue=ZAP
passwordParam=password
referer=http://0.0.0.0:8000/login`

Instances: 1

### Solution

This is an informational alert rather than a vulnerability and so there is nothing to fix.

Check for differences in response based on fuzzed User Agent (eg. mobile sites, access as a Search Engine Crawler). Compares the response statuscode and the hashcode of the response body with the original response.
