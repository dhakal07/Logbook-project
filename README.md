| 02.12.2024      | 5  | Phase 3 continues | Key Activities: During the first session, I spent time understanding the assignment requirements and setting up the development environment. I installed the Hono framework, configured the PostgreSQL database, and initialized routes for user registration and login. A major issue I encountered was the inability to connect to the database due to a misconfigured connection string. This error consumed considerable time as I had to troubleshoot by reviewing the database credentials and verifying that the PostgreSQL server was running. To resolve this, I adjusted the connection settings in the db.js file and tested the connection using a basic query. After confirming the connection was successful, I proceeded with confidence to build the application.|
| 04.12.2024      | 5  | workshop Session and Phase 3 continues | This session was dedicated to implementing user authentication, where I added functionality for user registration and login using bcrypt for password hashing. Additionally, I worked on session management to enable users to access protected routes after logging in. However, I faced a significant challenge when session data was not being stored or retrieved properly, resulting in users losing their session after logging in. Debugging this issue required careful analysis of the session handling logic. By adding detailed console logs and examining the request headers, I realized the issue stemmed from missing cookies in the request. To fix this, I implemented a helper function to parse cookies correctly and updated the middleware to ensure session validation worked seamlessly. |
| 05.12.2024      | 5  | Self practice of Phase 3 | In this day, I completed the implementation of middleware for role-based access control and conducted thorough testing of all routes. While testing, I discovered that the application was vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, as user input was not being properly sanitized before being displayed. This was a critical security flaw, so I prioritized addressing it. I added Content-Security-Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the execution of external scripts and sanitized user inputs before rendering them on pages. These measures ensured the application adhered to secure coding practices. By the end of this session, I successfully resolved all major issues and finalized the application. |
